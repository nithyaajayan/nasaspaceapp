ExoAI â€” Exoplanet Vetting Web Application

ExoAI is a lightweight web application that classifies exoplanet candidates into Confirmed or Candidate with their probabilities using an XGBoost machine learning model.  
The project integrates a Flask backend for API handling, a Tailwind CSS frontend for a minimal and responsive user interface, and a trained XGBoost model for predictions.

Project Overview

The purpose of this application is to demonstrate how machine learning models can be deployed as web services.  
Users can input planetary parameters or upload a dataset through a simple frontend interface, send them to the backend API, and receive model predictions in real time.

Tech Stack:
- Frontend: Tailwind CSS, HTML, JavaScript  
- Backend: Flask (Python)  
- Machine Learning: XGBoost  
- API Communication: REST (JSON)

How It Works

1. Frontend (Tailwind UI):
   The user interacts with a clean, minimal interface built using Tailwind. It collects planetary data and sends it to the backend API using `fetch()` or Axios.

2. Backend (Flask Server): 
   Flask handles incoming requests at defined endpoints (e.g., `/predict`). The backend loads the trained XGBoost model, processes input data, and returns a prediction as JSON.

3. Model (XGBoost):  
   The trained model evaluates the input features (such as radius, mass, orbital period, etc.) and classifies the target as a confirmed exoplanet or false positive.

4. API Response:  
   The backend sends the prediction result back to the frontend, which displays it on the web interface.
